    "Your task is to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words in the Shakespeare's Macbeth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A common python programming pattern to counting objects, produce histograms, or update statistics is to make calls to a dictionary as you iterate through a list. For example, given a list of words, you can create a dictionary to store counts and then iterate through the list of words, checking how many times each word has appeared using your dictionary, and updating the dictionary count now that you've seen that word again. The `dictionary.get()` method is very useful in doing this. Read the docstring for the dictionary.get() method and use it along with the pseudocode above to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words from the transcript of Macbeth which has been loaded into a variable 'Macbeth'. Be sure to include a title and appropriate labels for your graph."

Long liue the King\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words\\r\\nor letters they had often packed into a \"cliche\". . .this is the\\r\\noriginal meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling\\r\\nto unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions\\r\\nthat look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,\\r\\nabove. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming\\r\\nShakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is that they MAY have packed \"liue\" into a cliche at a\\r\\ntime when they were out of \"v\"\\'s. . .possibly having used \"vv\" in\\r\\nplace of some \"w\"\\'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,\\r\\nas print was still quite expensive, and they didn\\'t want to spend\\r\\nmore on a wider selection of characters than they had to.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will find a lot of these kinds of \"errors\" in this text, as I\\r\\nhave mentioned in other times and places, many \"scholars\" have an\\r\\nextreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a\\r\\nvery high place in the \"canon\" of Shakespeare.  My father read an\\r\\nassortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University\\r\\nin England for several months in a glass room constructed for the\\r\\npurpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available\\r\\n. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,\\r\\nthat Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a\\r\\nvariety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous\\r\\nfor signing his name with several different spellings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, please take this into account when reading the comments below\\r\\nmade by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors\\r\\nthat are \"not\" errors. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nSo. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,\\r\\nhere is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare\\'s The Tragedie\\r\\nof Macbeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael S.

This was taken from\\r\\na copy of Shakespeare\\'s first folio and it is as close as I can\\r\\ncome in ASCII to the printed text.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elongated S\\'s have been changed to small s\\'s and the\\r\\nconjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,\\r\\npunctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the\\r\\nprinted text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put\\r\\ntogether a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the\\r\\nGeneva Bible and Shakespeare\\'s First Folio and have unified\\r\\nspellings according to this template), typo\\'s and expanded\\r\\nabbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within\\r\\nbrackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don\\'t like that\\r\\nyou can delete everything within the brackets if you want a\\r\\npurer Shakespeare.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual\\r\\ndifferences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may\\r\\nbe differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between\\r\\nthis and other first folio e'"
