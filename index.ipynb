    "### Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words in the Shakespeare's Macbeth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A common python programming pattern to counting objects, produce histograms, or update statistics is to make calls to a dictionary as you iterate through a list. For example, given a list of words, you can create a dictionary to store counts and then iterate through the list of words, checking how many times each word has appeared using your dictionary, and updating the dictionary count now that you've seen that word again. The `dictionary.get()` method is very useful in doing this. Read the docstring for the dictionary.get() method and use it along with the pseudocode above to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words from the transcript of Macbeth which has been loaded into a variable 'Macbeth'. Be sure to include a title and appropriate labels for your graph."

Gutenberg s Etext of Shakespeare s The Tragedie of Macbeth Executive Director s Notes In addition to the notes below and so you will NOT think all the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have been corrected here are the first few lines of Hamlet as they are presented herein Barnardo Who s there Fran Nay answer me Stand vnfold your selfe Bar Long liue the King As I understand it the printers often ran out of certain words or letters they had often packed into a cliche this is the original meaning of the term cliche and thus being unwilling to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions that look very odd such as the exchanges of u for v v for u above and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner The answer is that they MAY have packed liue into a cliche at a time when they were out of v s possibly having used vv in place of some w s etc This was a common practice of the day as print was still quite expensive and they didn t want to spend more on a wider selection of characters than they had to You will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as I have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a very high place in the canon of Shakespeare My father read an assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the purpose To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available in great detail and determined from the various changes that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a variety of errors we credit him for even though he was in famous for signing his name with several different spellings So please take this into account when reading the comments below made by our volunteer who prepared this file you may see errors that are not errors So with this caveat we have NOT changed the canon errors here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare s The Tragedie of Macbeth Michael S Hart Project Gutenberg Executive Director Scanner s Notes What this is and isn t This was taken from a copy of Shakespeare s first folio and it is as close as I can come in ASCII to the printed text The elongated S s have been changed to small s s and the conjoined ae have been changed to ae I have left the spelling punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the printed text I have corrected some spelling mistakes I have put together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the Geneva Bible and Shakespeare s First Folio and have unified spellings according to this template typo s and expanded abbreviations as I have come across them Everything within brackets is what I have added So if you don t like that you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a purer Shakespeare Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual differences between various copies of the first folio So there may be differences other than what I have mentioned above between this and other first folio editions This is due to the printer s habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then continuing the printing run The proof run wasn t thrown away but incorporated into the printed copies This is just the way it is The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different First Folio editions best pages If you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel free to email me those errors I wish to make this the best etext possible My email address for right now are haradda aol com and davidr
