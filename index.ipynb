    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words in the Shakespeare's Macbeth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A common python programming pattern to counting objects, produce histograms, or update statistics is to make calls to a dictionary as you iterate through a list. For example, given a list of words, you can create a dictionary to store counts and then iterate through the list of words, checking how many times each word has appeared using your dictionary, and updating the dictionary count now that you've seen that word again. The `dictionary.get()` method is very useful in doing this. Read the docstring for the dictionary.get() method and use it along with the pseudocode above to create a bar graph of the 25 most common words from the transcript of Macbeth which has been loaded into a variable 'Macbeth'. Be sure to include a title and appropriate labels for your graph."
